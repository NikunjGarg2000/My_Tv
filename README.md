# **My Tv**

### My app to watch live tv using firebase, ExoPlayer by google and Recycler View for UI.

### Hey, This is a simple app containing different sections like Entertainment, Infotainment, Movies, News, Music.

### : limited channels available

## Important Links

### For Storing links in the form of custom json file:

### <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Google Firebase</a>

### For Playing .m3u8 live video file

### <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/exoplayer">ExoPlayer by Google</a>

#### I am not providing link to download app since the live tv links keep changing just sharing my approach.
